Acylic graph.

An acyclic graph is a graph that has no cycles, or loops. 
In graph theory and computer science, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a type of acyclic graph that has vertices and edges,
with each edge pointing from one vertex to another.
In a DAG, it's not possible to follow the edges and end up back at the starting vertex

Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

Topological sorting - order nodes in a linear order so that every nodes comes before the node it points to
